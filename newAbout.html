As the App Development Lead for Disordered, I’ve designed and prototyped the app experience in Figma, laying the foundation for its development next semester. This project embodies my passion for interdisciplinary collaboration, as each team member brings a unique and crucial skillset to Disordered. I'm also deeply committed to mental health awareness and de-stigmatizing conversations around it. With Disordered, I aim to help present mental health disorders in a more compassionate light, fostering better understanding and self-reflection for users.</p>

I generate soundscapes that relate to the website’s significance towards mindfulness and meditation. I’ve always felt like music takes a huge part in our mental health and how it calms our nerves. With the use of Ableton Live 12 as our main DAW, I’m grateful to express my musical skills and translate it into an entertaining yet meaningful platform for mental health awareness. With Disordered, I am able to provide an intuitive yet sonically-pleasing approach that can lure in audiences to understand more about the website and its de-stigmatization surrounding mental disorders.</p>

I am on both our Web Development and App Development team, helping create some of the stylistic choices and functionality present throughout our web and mobile products. Disordered holds an extremely special place in my heart due to the way mental health advocacy has made a positive impact on my own life; as someone diagnosed with multiple mood disorders, I have always been eager to share my experiences and knowledge with others to help those around me. Creating this project gave me the perfect outlet to do so, and I'm proud of the work we've put together as a team.</p>

Personally, this project is very important to me as it brings attention to mental health awareness—something that is often disregarded or can be misleading.
